# DOMTokenList shim

A super strict shim/polyfill for [DOMTokenList](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-domtokenlist), classList and relList. Small, < 1 kB minified and gzipped (~ 2kB minified).

## Usage
All you need to do is include the JavaScript file and everything will be ready to go.
If native DOMTokenList support is detected, nothing will be done.

```
<script src="domtokenlist.min.js"></script>
```
